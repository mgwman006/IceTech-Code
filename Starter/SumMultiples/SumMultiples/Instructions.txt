Given positive integers below 12 that are multiples of 2 or 5, we get 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10. The sum of these multiples is 35.
Complete the solution so the Sum method calculates and returns the result of the sum of multiples of 2 or 5 below the number that is passed in to it.
In the case where you find a number that is a multiple of both 2 and 5, only count it once.
